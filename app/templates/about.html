										<h2 class="major">Communicando</h2>
										<p>Communicando is the literary club of CBIT. It was started in 2007 with the aim to give students an opportunity to grow as individuals by enriching their soft skills. The name of the club itself means “come you and I can do” implying that with team spirit and perseverance we can enrich ourselves and make miracles happen. So as to achieve this goal, the students of Communicando come together every few weeks and brainstorm to organise events in English, Hindi and Telugu. The events range from public speaking to creative writing events (poem, essay and story writing) which give the diverse student crowd in CBIT a chance to take a break from strenuous class work and participate in events which let them explore themselves and the world. Not only this but Communicando also organises workshops and invites eminent personalities who impart their skills and help students polish their skills.</p>

										<p>CBIT being one of the top city colleges encourages students to excel in both academics and co-curriculars as well, Communicando being one such club which helps the student coordinators from all branches first, second and third years to get better at soft skills such as  time management, leadership ,planning and creativity to name a few. Not only this but being a part of Communicando has helped students meet like minded individuals and form life long friendships. Many of the ex-students who have acquired jobs at big companies and masters at the top universities credit being a part of Communicando to their success.</p>


										<p>Communicando has exciting plans for the future and the coordinators believe that the sky is the limit. We hope to establish dramatics and a book lovers club in the coming years where in students can meet people with similar interests and enjoy their hobbies with the support of the college.</p>

												Literati is the annual literary fest of CBIT, conducted by Communicando. It takes place in March every year, and every edition of Literati brings with it an exciting and rewarding array of events. There are a number of competitions conducted, and the events are a mix of time-tested classics and innovative new ideas. Literati spans two days, and tests participants for various skills. Literati has, over the years since its inception, been a refreshing break for students from the daily grind of their curriculum. It allows students to explore their talents and find a platform for them, going beyond academic and technical ability. These activities serve the purpose of making students good communicators and teamworkers. Organising the fest itself is no small feat, with weeks of planning, effort, and dedication being put in by the Communicando team.</p>

											<p>Communication, writing, speaking, presence of mind, leadership are only few of the qualities that we seek to bring out. Events include several rounds, testing participants in debate, group discussion, elocution, critical thinking, decision-making, general knowledge etc. There are comprehensive standards for judging and evaluating performances, and the prizes are an added incentive. The main attraction of Literati, however, lies in the fact that it allows students to present a side of themselves to themselves and their peers that is rarely seen otherwise. Most importantly, it is a welcome opportunity for enthusiastic students to compete with each other, and have some fun doing it.</p>

												We at Communicando believe in constantly growing and making ourselves familiar with the upcoming forms of literary art and that’s why have been actively working towards inviting accomplished personalities from various fields to conduct workshops where the participants get to interact and experiment.</p>

The Young Orators Club of Secunderabad is a place where people of all ages, backgrounds, and professions come together to participate in public speaking sessions.The club has been active in promoting the art of oratory in the city, especially among students for over 40 years now. </p>

											<p>The speakers spoke about the impact that good orators create on their audience and the importance of staying true to your opinions while speaking, this was followed by an impromptu speaking session followed by brief evaluation!</p>

											<p>One of the biggest events of Literati 7.0 was a microfiction workshop conducted by the co founder of Terribly Tiny Tales, Anuj Gosalia. Terribly Tiny Tales which became an internet sensation in 2014 and is now one of the country’s most beloved story telling platform which brings together a diverse pool of authors to create tweet sized stories everyday. </p>

											<p>The workshop saw over 250 participants from different fields of life, the participants did not just learn how the the Terribly Tiny Tales  are created but also penned down a few Terribly Tiny Tales on their own based on the prompts provided.</p>

											<p><strong>We hope to conduct many more such workshops in the near future.</strong></p>

											<p>
												Communicando has set off this year with a bang. The past few weeks have been exhilarating for us at communicando. We have organized exciting events, each being unique and compelling in its own way.</p>

												<p>Poetry is a mesmerizing and beautiful art form. It’s a shame to say that in this modern age, poetry is becoming a lost art. To keep its spirit alive and kicking, communicando organized a “spoken word poetry” event. The theme being “what teachers make”. The event was kept to promote spoken word, which is a growing art form. Being the first of its kind, this event was an absolute delight for any poet enthusiast, the poems presented were a tribute to teachers, and they stood up to the mark of communicando. No teacher was left dry eyed, the beautiful poems moved everyone in the room.</p>

											<p>Communicando also organises events specifically for the freshers to make them familiar with the many events that the club organises. This year two events were conducted for the freshers, the english event being “Game of words” and the telugu one being “ Paddam Pattu Sametha Kattu”.</p>

											<p>While Game of Words was an exciting word themed events where the participants had to race against the clock to come up with maximum number of words using a set of letters and later used their wits to pysch their opponents. Paddam Pattu Sametha Kattu was a fun filled telugu sametha i.e proverb based game where the participants’ knowledge of the many wise proverbs was tested.</p>

											<h3 class="major" >CBITMUN</h3>
											<p>
												Back   in   2011   CBIT   MUN   club   was   started   by   a   group   of   debate   enthusiasts   with   the   motto to   set   up,   encourage   and   endorse   Model   United   Nations   Conferences   in   the   city   of Hyderabad.   It   was   Model   United   Nations   Initiative   for   the   first   time   of   its   level   in   the   city   of Hyderabad   under   the   Literary   Club   of   CBIT,   Communicando.   As   years   passed   it   has   not   only succeeded   in   conducting   a   world   class   conference   every   year,   with   a   sharp   increase   in   the number   of   participants   with   every   edition.   Since   its   inception   the   club   has   stood   for   the quality   of   debate   and   hospitality   it   delivers   during   the   conference.</p>

												<p>Model   United   Nations   (also   Model   UN   or   MUN)   is   a   student   directed   academic   simulation of   the   United   Nations   Organization.   An   estimated   400   model   UN   conferences   are   held annually   around   the   world   where   students   come   together   with   the   aim   of   learning   how these   assemblies   function   and   also   to   interact   and   work   with   people   who   have   the potential   to   be   change   leaders   of   the   next   generation.   Most   MUN   participants   have demonstrated   in   the   past   that   they   can   become   great   leaders   in   politics,   law   and   even education.   The   participants         addressed      as   “delegates”      role-play   diplomats      while representing      a   country      of      their      choice,   investigate         international         issues,   debate, deliberate,   consult   on   this   forum   and   then   arrive   at   a   comprehensive   consensus   to   real world   problems.</p>

											<p>CBITMUN   2016   shattered   all   the   standing   records.   With   a   delegate   count   of   over   310   and   a footfall   of   almost   500   people,   the   6th   edition   had   etched   itself   a   niche   of   its   own.   But   the delegate   count   wasn't   all   that   it   had   offered.   It   withheld   the   traditions   and   stayed   loyal   to the   roots   of   the   club.   After   5   successful   editions,   such   a   feat   is   beyond   praise.   Added   to that,   this   edition   gave   back   to   the   society   by   spending   a   day   at   the   Devarakonda   Basti School   and   brightening   the   day   of   the   kids   by   giving   them   some   basic   everyday   essentials like   a   pair   of   slippers,   notebooks,   stationery   and   candies.   The   Training   Team   Initiative taught   the   students   of   RockWell   International   the   essence   of   an   MUN.   Every   year,   our   club comes   up   with   innovative   ways   of   improving   the   culture   of   MUNs   and   with   every   edition   we have   scaled      up   the   standards   in   terms   of   magnitude </p>
